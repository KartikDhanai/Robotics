# Robotics

During my internship at SPACE, I gained valuable experience developing code for LED Blink, Ultrasonic Sensor, Obstacle Avoidance Robot, and Joystick Robot projects. These tasks allowed me to learn about controlling hardware devices, integrating sensors into robotics systems, detecting obstacles, and developing code for external input devices. Overall, the internship was an excellent learning experience that enhanced my programming skills and provided practical knowledge of robotics.
